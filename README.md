This capstone project focuses on developing a machine learning system to help hospitals identify high-risk patients in real time using only their vital signs. Using a dataset of over 97,000 patient records from Kaggle, we analyzed variables like heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, BMI, and temperature. Our goal was to classify patients into Low, Medium, High, or Extreme risk categories to support faster triage decisions. We tested several modelsâ€”Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 65.34% with an AUC of 0.72, while XGBoost outperformed with an accuracy of 65.55%, sensitivity of 61.84%, and specificity of 68.95%. K-Means Clustering also proved useful, achieving similar performance without labeled data. The findings show a strong relationship between BMI and heart rate, especially in high-risk groups. This model has the potential to improve emergency care efficiency by enabling faster and more informed decision-making.
